# BioClimate-Variables-Calculate
These code aims to calculate for bioclimate variables Bio1 to Bio19, and the raw data is derived from Satellite Era5 
## 1. Input file format
The data can be downloded frome Era5 by GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform or use your own raw data with the same format. Example raw data : Raw Data Era5.csv
## 2. Input Fishnet IDs & Start-date-End-date
Main program show example for parameter settings.
## 3. Output format
We acquire BIO parameter for each given year. The next step is calculate the statistics you would like. The example is also provided in Main.ipynb
